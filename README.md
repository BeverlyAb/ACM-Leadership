###Interested In Running The Club? 

Elections are held at minimum once per school year, typically during Spring quarter, or in the event of unforseen vacancies in the officership. You can nominate yourself or a peer you feel is qualified by informing an officer/cabinet through email or spoken word. 

_Note that the officers and cabinets may prescribe additional information necessary for inclusion on the election ballot, including (but not limited to), the individual's Coyote ID number or email address._


The voting procedures will be carried out in such a way that does not create bias towards any participants involved, and is accessible to the maximal number of club members possible.

Newly elected officers will assume the office at the monthly meeting following elections and will remain in office for one full year. Officers who previously held the position shall be kept available for a transition period of one month, during which they shall provide support to the new officers. 

More thorough information about the election procedure can be read on the [ACM Constitution and Bylaws](https://github.com/CSE-Club/Constitution).
